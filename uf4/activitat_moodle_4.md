I  this activity you are going to create a course for Moodle in English.

The course has to be related to the teaching of one craft, you have a list of crafts [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outline_of_crafts).

In the course you have to create **TWO SECTIONS**, each for a topic on your course.

**IN EACH Section** of the course you are going to create:

- One resource involving a pdf attached to Moodle.
- One task with an attached Google Form URL with 10 questions related to the resources.
- One task related to the resources.

You have to enroll a teacher that creates the resouces and tasks and qualifies the exercises (from 0 to 10) and a student that answers the tasks.
